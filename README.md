# SoltrOS - Desktop Edition

A gaming-optimized immutable Linux distribution based on Universal Blue's base image, featuring MacBook hardware support, gaming enhancments, the latest Cinnamon Desktop, comprehensive package management, and developer-friendly tools.

*Inspired by [VenOS](https://github.com/Venefilyn/veneos) - bringing together the best of gaming and productivity.*

### Installation
Right now, the easiest way to get SoltrOS working is to download [Fedora Silverblue](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/silverblue/download) and install it. Then, run:
```
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/soltros/soltros-os:latest

sudo systemctl reboot
```
The "Latest" image will give you the experience that is suggested (Cosmic). However, if you'd like to check out other versions (that are still under development as well), you can. Just check the "packages" section.
