## ⚠️ Project Status: Retired

**Effective [Date], the desktop edition of [Soltros OS] is no longer maintained.**

After considerable thought, I've made the decision to retire the desktop edition of this project. This wasn't an easy choice, but it's the right one for several reasons:

- **Solo maintenance burden**: As the sole maintainer, keeping up with the demands of a desktop OS has become unsustainable
- **Ecosystem overlap**: The rpm-ostree ecosystem has matured significantly, and there are now several excellent alternatives that serve similar purposes
- **Energy and focus**: I'd rather step back than provide a subpar experience due to lack of bandwidth

### What This Means

- **Desktop Edition**: No longer maintained. No further updates will be released.
- **Server Edition**: Continues as planned. The minimal maintenance requirements and automated workflows make this sustainable to maintain.
