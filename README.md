# Working on Soltros OS was a huge learning experience for me. I learned a lot about RPM-Ostree and cloud-native distributions. However, I want to turn my interests back to NixOS. Soltros OS is fully automatic, and will auto-rebuild for LTS and Unstable every few days, and will always be updated to reach new upstreams.

# SoltrOS - Desktop Edition

![Soltros OS Screenshot](https://github.com/soltros/Soltros-OS/blob/main/screenshots/Screenshot%20From%202025-07-03%2004-33-37.png?raw=true)

A gaming-optimized, rolling immutable Linux distribution based on Fedora releases, featuring MacBook hardware support, the latest kernel, gaming performance enhancements, the KDE Plasma desktop environment, and developer-friendly tools.

*Inspired by [VeneOS](https://github.com/Venefilyn/veneos) - bringing together the best of gaming and productivity.*

### Installation
There are a few ways you can install SoltrosOS. The recomended way is to download the official ISO, flash it to a USB device, and install it to your computer.

You can get the latest bleeding-edge edition ISO [here](https://bit.ly/soltros-os-unstable), and the stable edition ISO [here](https://bit.ly/soltros-os-stable). Once Soltros OS is installed, it rolls updates forever. No need to swap to new ISOs every 6 months. The bleeding-edge distribution is based upon the absolute newest packages available from Rawhide, and can be a bit rocky to use. The LTS version is pinned to the 6-month Fedora cycle.


 However, you can also install it through Silverblue/Kinoite/Bazzite/Bluefin with Bootc Switch:

```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/soltros/soltros-os:latest
sudo systemctl reboot
```
Or

```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/soltros/soltros-os_lts:latest
sudo systemctl reboot
```

# NOTICE:
There has been an issue with policy.json not being generated correctly, resulting in an issue with bootc. This should now be fixed in future, fresh installed images as well as the ISO. However, if you are experiencing this issue on a current version of SoltrOS, please do the following or updating will not work:

### 1. Download the public key
```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/pki/containers
sudo curl -L https://github.com/soltros/Soltros-OS/raw/main/soltros.pub -o /etc/pki/containers/soltros.pub
```
### 2. Download the secure policy
```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/containers
sudo curl -L https://github.com/soltros/Soltros-OS/raw/main/resources/policy.json -o /etc/containers/policy.json
```
### 3. Verify permissions
```
sudo chmod 644 /etc/pki/containers/soltros.pub
sudo chmod 644 /etc/containers/policy.json
```
